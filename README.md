# .zshrc
my zshrc

Thanks to cypher-neo  for his help with the wicked colors and to robbyrussell for the inspiration to get a non standard prompt.


This is my custom and updated ~/.zshrc, feel free to use portions or all of it as you wish I merely ask that attributions be made as they fit...

If you wish to add and not fork please leave your github or other info to be added here for credits as is only right.
